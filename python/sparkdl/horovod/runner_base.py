    """
    HorovodRunner runs distributed deep learning training jobs using Horovod.

    On Databricks Runtime for Machine Learning 5.0+, it launches the Horovod job as a distributed
    Spark job.  It makes running Horovod easy on Databricks by managing the cluster setup and
    integrating with Spark.  Check out Databricks documentation to view end-to-end examples and
    performance tuning tips.

    The open-source version only runs the job locally inside the same Python process,
    which is for local development only.

    .. note:: Horovod is a distributed training framework developed by Uber.

            This argument only takes effect on Databricks Runtime for Machine Learning 5.0+.
            It is ignored in the open-source version.
            Accepted values are:

            - If -1, this will spawn a subprocess on the driver node to run the Horovod job locally.
              Training stdout and stderr messages go to the notebook cell output.
              This is useful for debugging and we recommend testing your code under this mode first.
              However, be careful of heavy use of the Spark driver on a shared Databricks cluster.
            - If >0, this will launch a Spark job with `np` tasks starting all together and run the
              Horovod job on the task nodes.
              It will wait until `np` task slots are available to launch the job.
              If `np` is greater than the total number of task slots on the cluster,
              the job will fail.
              Training stdout and stderr messages are redirected to the stderr stream of the first
              task, which you can find in the Spark UI.
            - If 0, this will use all task slots on the cluster to launch the job.

            please change global states inside the function, e.g., setting logging level,
            and be aware of pickling limitations.
            Avoid referencing large objects in the function, which might result large pickled data,
