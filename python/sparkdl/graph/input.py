class TFInputGraph(object):
    """
    An opaque object containing TensorFlow graph.
    This object can be serialized.

    .. note:: We recommend constructing this object using one of the class constructor methods.

              - :py:meth:`fromGraph`
              - :py:meth:`fromGraphDef`
              - :py:meth:`fromCheckpoint`

              - :py:meth:`fromSavedModel`
              - :py:meth:`fromSavedModelWithSignature`


    When the graph contains serving signatures in which a set of well-known names are associated
    with their corresponding raw tensor names in the graph, we extract and store them here.
    For example, the TensorFlow saved model may contain the following structure,
    so that end users can retrieve the the input tensor via `well_known_input_sig` and
    the output tensor via `well_known_output_sig` without knowing the actual tensor names a priori.

    .. code-block:: python

        sigdef: {'well_known_prediction_signature':
        inputs { key: "well_known_input_sig"
          value {
            name: "tnsrIn:0"
            dtype: DT_DOUBLE
            tensor_shape { dim { size: -1 } dim { size: 17 } }
            }
          }
        outputs { key: "well_known_output_sig"
          value {
            name: "tnsrOut:0"
            dtype: DT_DOUBLE
            tensor_shape { dim { size: -1 } }
            }
        }}


    In this case, the class will internally store the mapping from signature names to tensor names.
